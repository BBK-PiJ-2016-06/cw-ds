The output of the various checking tools should be paid attention to although checkstyle is a little "aggressive".

Going forward make appropriate use of packages.

Good set of tests.

Please see the general comments, some of which are applicable to your submission.

StackImpl

@Override
  public boolean isEmpty() {
    if (internalList.isEmpty()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

Don't return true/false unless absolutely necessary. In this case

return internalList.isEmpty()

should have been used. This also applies to some other methods.

DRY - don't repeat javadoc from interfaces to implementation - make use of "@see" and
"@inherit".

SampleableList

ation == 0 || indexLocation % 2

use appropriate constants rather than "magic numbers".

If you create classes/methods that are only used internally, e.g.,

public final class ParameterVerifier {

then make the classes/methods "private" or "package" access.
Similarly for LinkedListNode
